# Pomodoro

## Background

The Pomodoro Method is a time management technique developed by Francesco Cirillo that divides work into 25-minute intervals, called "Pomodoros," followed by short 5-minute breaks. After completing four Pomodoros, a longer break of 15 to 30 minutes is taken. This method enhances focus, reduces mental fatigue, and improves overall productivity by encouraging regular rest.

## Motivation

Simple application for development practice.
